# stampdf

Stamp a short text string in the most suitable location onto every page of a PDF file.

stampdf requires Java to run but is otherwise a fully self-contained shell script(ish) without any other dependencies.


## Rationale

The primary use case for `stampdf` is to automatically add a short identifier (think document number) to each page of a document without obstructing the contents. This is useful when you send out documents that may get printed, annotated by hand, scanned, and sent back to you again (hello, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª).


## Download

You can get a pre-built "binary" here or you can build it yourself:

```shell
make release
ls target/stampdf
```


## Usage

See `stampdf --help`; a possibly outdated version is reproduced below.

```
stampdf 0.9.0 -- stamp a short text string in the most suitable location onto every page of a PDF

usage: stampdf [OPTION]... INPUT-FILE TEXT

options:
  -i, --in-place         overwrite the input file, use with care
  -o, --output FILENAME  filename of the stamped output file
  -w, --overwrite        overwrite output file if it exists
  -h, --help
